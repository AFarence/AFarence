- 👋 Hi, I’m @AFarence
- 👀 I’m interested in using data to tell cool and amazing stories (I'm a journalist)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, machine learning (primarily sci-kit learn), and soon I'll learn cool ways to visualize data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web scraping and data visualization projects.
